This is an awesome **Django Project Boilerplate**!!

very quickly, with just a few steps!

Some of the TaskBuster Django Project Boilerplate functionalities are:

- **different virtual environments** for developing, testing and production
- Project structure
- **HTML5 Boilerplate**
- Template Inheritance
- Functional **tests**

To start using the Boilerplate, check out the :doc:`requirements`
